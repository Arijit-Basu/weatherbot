Data formats:

1. A file containing the combinations of keywords to look for in the input, separated by |. 1st item will be an ID.
2. A file containing responses to each of the keyword combinations present in the first file. Use the ID to relate response to keywords
3. A file containing list of data files, '|' separated.
4. Any number of data files required for the application

Algorithm:

1. Read the keyword combinations file
2. Read the response file and store in a dictionary with ID as the key
3. Read the list file and store as a list
4. Read input from user and try fetching response from the dictionary. Use appropriate data files as needed.
5. Each input and corresponding output is to be stored in a list to provide context information

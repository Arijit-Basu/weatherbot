A chat bot to query about weather from google weather api using natural language queries (english)

Features:
It can answer english queries about weather, temperature and different conditions.

* Is it going to rain in new york in the next 3 days?
* What'll be the temperature on wednesday?
* Will i have a storn in the next 2 days?
